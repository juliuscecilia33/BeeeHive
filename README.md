# Beeehive

## Dubhacks
Beeehive was a project built with my team at the DubHacks hackathon 2020, the largest 24-hour hackathon hosted in the Pacific Northwest. Even though it was fully virtual, my team was able to bond tremendously together creating unforgettable memories during the development of the website. Almost spending all night, we were so grateful with the outcome of our hard work and was actually credited by one of the judges! While we didn’t officially win, my first Hackathon will always be one to remember because of the project we developed and the unbelievable team I had.

## About
BeeeHive Project, a website designed to combine communication channels such as groupme or Discord that have become popular in the new age of online learning, was created with the help of a team from Dubhacks Hackathon 2020! Beeehive's interface focuses on accessibility, allowing users with different skill levels with technology to use Beehive’s simple interface to enhance e-learning.

Whether you’re a student looking to collaborate in real-time or a professor looking for a simple and fast way to post class details, Beehive is the solution for you! It’s hassle-free, features class calendars and collaborative whiteboards, and is accessible for all technical skill levels!

Beehive is a website designed to combine communication channels such as groupme, discord, and slack, all programs that have become popular in the new age of online learning. Teachers and teaching assistants can push due dates for assignments and exams and hold office hours, while students can chat in different assignment channels about coursework. Whiteboard breakout rooms with voice chat aim to simulate experiences found in a real classroom. Our interface focuses on accessibility, allowing users with different skill levels with technology to use Beehive’s simple interface to enhance e-learning.

## Contributions
I was in charge on the Frontend side of the app using React.js which at the time I had little experience with. But as hours gradually passed, I was able to pick up React.js with ease and we were able to complete the entire website by the due date! I used React.js to develop a dynamic UI for the users and helped integrate all the backend services to the existing code as well.

## Features
Beehive is an online environment designed to foster clear communication in instructor and student interactions. All students enrolled in a class are given a server code to join an ecosystem conducive to teaching assistant office hours, group project brainstorming, and exam preparation. Beehive seamlessly merges current messaging apps, video sharing services, and online classroom forums onto one platform.

Beehive does not serve as a replacement for an entire course management system (such as Canvas, Blackboard, CCLE, etc.) but rather as an all-encompassing tool to simulate interactions found in a conventional classroom such as breakout sessions, one-on-one talks with Teachers/Teaching Assistants, and casual conversation relating to the course. Key features in our app include the whiteboard breakout room option, which allows one participant to interact with a board, and a calendar populated by the instructors to remind students of due dates.

Beehive is implemented with React, and consists of several Classes (“components”) that are declared in javascript files. The three main components are the Sidebar, a Classbar, and the content for a cluster or discussion channel. The Sidebar links to several class pages, each of which link to informational and group work channels.

To implement Beehive’s integrated whiteboards we utilized the collaborative Socket IO whiteboard. Several users can annotate the whiteboard at a time, and the whiteboard is automatically cleared each time the cluster is emptied and then a new group joins.

## Future
In the future, I’m hoping to revisit this project and add the features we missed out on. The potential this application has to impact many students is something that’s always been on my mind and I’m hoping to make it actually happen. I’ll look to make it a powerful full stack application that can able to handle all the features and data storage. Maybe even one day, me and my team will reunite to finish this project all together!
